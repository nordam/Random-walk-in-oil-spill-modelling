# Random walk in oil spill modelling

This repository contains
* A simple 1D particle based oil spill model
* Setup and results from a GOTM simulation

The purpose of the particle model is to demonstrate the difference between using a consistent and an inconsistent random walk scheme. It can be run as-is, and will produce a plot showing a time series of surfaced oil, and concentration profiles of submerged oil. These plots demonstrate the difference between two different random walk schemes, for two different diffusivity profiles.

One of the diffusivity profiles have been derived from a GOTM simulation. The setup files and result file from the GOTM run is also included.

A publication (open access) describing the theory and implementation is available here: [www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X19305338](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X19305338)
